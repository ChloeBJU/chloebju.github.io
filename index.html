<h1>CHLOE BUFFALINO</h1>

<h2>Freshman, Bob Jones University</h2>
<p1>I'm a freshman at <a href= http://www.bju.edu/> Bob Jones University </a>  studying International Studies. On top of being a student, during the week I also work part time at Information Technologies for Bob Jones University, and I enjoy doing that a lot. 
I'm also involved with many church activities within my church which is <a href= http://www.mountcalvarybaptist.org/> Mount Calvary Baptist Church </a> </p1>
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p2> During my free time I enjoy spending time with friends and family. Additionally, learning languages 
and traveling have always been hobbies of mine as well. I've had the opportunity to travel to several countries and see the different cultures, religions, and foods 
that gives such an intersting insight into how people from different countries think. </p2>
